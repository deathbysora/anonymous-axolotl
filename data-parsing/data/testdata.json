Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.'}
